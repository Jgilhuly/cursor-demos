# Cursor AI Demo Repository

A collection of demo projects designed to showcase AI-powered development capabilities. Each subdirectory contains a different type of development challenge that demonstrates how AI coding assistants can help solve real-world programming problems.

## Overview

This repository contains 9 different demo projects across various domains of software development. Each demo is designed as a starting point with intentional gaps, inefficiencies, or security issues that need to be addressed - perfect for demonstrating AI-assisted development workflows.

## Demo Categories

- **üåê Web Development**: Frontend frameworks, component optimization, API integration
- **üìä Data Science**: Pipeline optimization, notebook refactoring, data processing
- **üöÄ Backend Development**: API development, database integration, server optimization
- **üîê Security Engineering**: Authentication, authorization, vulnerability remediation
- **üîß Legacy Modernization**: Code migration, modularization, architectural improvements

## Demo Projects

- **Technologies**: JavaScript, Module Systems

### üìä Data Science & ML Engineering

#### **Legacy Pandas Pipeline** (`legacy-pandas-pipeline/`)
A Jupyter notebook with DataFrame processing using inefficient for-loops.
- **Challenge**: Optimize data processing performance and modernize the pipeline
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Jupyter

#### **Notebook to Package** (`notebook-to-package/`)
A messy Jupyter notebook mixing analysis, plotting, and utility code.
- **Challenge**: Refactor notebook code into a proper Python package structure
- **Technologies**: Python, Jupyter, Data Analysis

## Getting Started

Each demo project includes its own README with specific setup instructions. Generally, you'll need to:

1. **Choose a demo project** that interests you
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
3. **Read the project's README** for specific setup instructions
4. **Install dependencies** (usually `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
5. **Start the development server** or run the application
